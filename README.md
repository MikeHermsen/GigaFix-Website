# Setup
To use this project download the ZIP and unpack it to the location you want it stored. To use/open the project run the index.php file. ( This won't work because it is an php file, Instead use xlamp)
Because there is still work in progress there won't be anything in the main folder. All files are located in the test-site folder.
